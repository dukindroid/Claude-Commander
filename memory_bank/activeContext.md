# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Planning and Initial Data Setup Phase
The project is currently in the foundational phase, focusing on:
1. **Tool Setup and Familiarization**: Successfully configured Docker, Odoo 18, and MCP servers
2. **Data Import Strategy**: Working on CSV-based initial data loading for employees, fleet, and inventory
3. **User Import Progress**: Created comprehensive guide for employee data import (see `db_init/user_initialization_guide.md`)

### Immediate Priority: Employee Data Import
- **Status**: Template and process documented
- **Next Step**: Need to structure employee CSV with proper departmental hierarchy
- **Blocker**: Organizational chart needs to be defined before employee import
- **Dependencies**: Role definitions should precede user creation

## Recent Changes

### Documentation Structure
- Established comprehensive memory bank following Cline's requirements
- Created detailed PRD documents (`prd-odoo.md` and `prd.md`) with different approaches
- Documented progress and technical decisions in `progress.md`

### Technical Setup
- Docker environment configured and tested
- Odoo 18 Community installation verified
- MCP servers configured:
  - Context7 for Odoo documentation
  - mcp-odoo for direct Odoo integration
  - whatsapp-mcp for communication
  - Google Drive MCP for document management

### Data Import Framework
- CSV import methodology established
- Employee import template created
- Process documentation completed in `db_init/user_initialization_guide.md`

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Define Organizational Structure**
   - Create company organigram
   - Define departments: Operations, Maintenance, Administration, Procurement, Warehouse
   - Establish role hierarchy: Director, Supervisor, Operator, Mechanic, etc.

2. **Employee Data Import**
   - Finalize CSV structure with roles and departments
   - Import employee data from Google Drive source
   - Configure user permissions and access levels

3. **Fleet Module Setup**
   - Register all mining vehicles and equipment
   - Assign operators to specific units
   - Configure maintenance schedules and templates

4. **Inventory Module Configuration**
   - Set up spare parts and materials catalog
   - Define warehouse locations and storage areas
   - Establish procurement workflows

### Phase 2: Operational Workflows (Weeks 5-8)
1. **Maintenance Work Orders**
   - Configure preventive maintenance schedules
   - Set up work order templates
   - Integrate with inventory for parts tracking

2. **Real-time Status Updates**
   - Configure fleet status tracking
   - Set up automated notifications
   - Create role-based dashboards

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Platform Choice Validation
- **Decision**: Odoo Community 18.0 over custom development
- **Rationale**: Faster implementation, proven modules, extensive documentation
- **Trade-offs**: Learning curve for Python/Odoo, limited to community features

### Data Import Strategy
- **Decision**: CSV-based initial data loading
- **Rationale**: Simple, reliable, and supported by Odoo's import tools
- **Implementation**: Structured templates for each data type (employees, fleet, inventory)

### Development Approach
- **Decision**: AI-assisted development with Claude Code
- **Rationale**: Compensates for Python/Odoo knowledge gap
- **Support Tools**: MCP servers for documentation and integration

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Documentation Standards
- Comprehensive memory bank maintenance for context preservation
- Bilingual documentation (Spanish for business context, English for technical)
- Progress tracking with clear phase definitions and milestones

### Technical Patterns
- Docker-first deployment for consistency
- Modular implementation focusing on core modules first
- CSV-based data exchange for simplicity and reliability
- Role-based access control leveraging Odoo's built-in capabilities

### User Experience Priorities
- Mobile-first design for field operations
- Simplified interfaces requiring minimal training
- Real-time updates for operational visibility
- Progressive disclosure based on user roles

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Discoveries
1. **Odoo's Power**: The platform provides significantly more functionality than initially expected
2. **Docker Benefits**: Containerization simplifies development environment management
3. **MCP Integration**: Claude's enhanced capabilities through MCP servers dramatically improve development efficiency
4. **Data Structure Importance**: Proper organizational hierarchy is critical before user import

### Risk Mitigation
- **Knowledge Gap**: Addressed through AI assistance and comprehensive documentation
- **Complexity Management**: Phased approach prevents overwhelming scope
- **User Adoption**: Focus on simplicity and role-based interfaces

### Success Factors
- Clear documentation and context preservation
- Incremental implementation with user feedback
- Leveraging proven platforms rather than custom development
- Strong AI assistance for technical challenges

## Current Blockers and Solutions

### Organizational Data
- **Blocker**: Need complete employee list with roles and departments
- **Solution**: Coordinate with management to provide Google Drive access to personnel data

### Role Definition
- **Blocker**: Company organigram not yet defined
- **Solution**: Work with management to establish departmental structure and role hierarchy

### Fleet Information
- **Blocker**: Waiting for complete fleet inventory and specifications
- **Solution**: Request detailed vehicle list with operator assignments and maintenance history

## Context for Next Session

When resuming work, priority should be:
1. Review any new organizational data provided
2. Complete role and department structure definition
3. Finalize employee CSV import process
4. Begin fleet module configuration

The foundation is solid, and the next phase requires business stakeholder input to proceed with data import and configuration.
