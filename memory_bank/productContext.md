# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Grupo Minero La Fundici√≥n, a mining company with ~40 employees, faces significant operational inefficiencies due to unstructured fleet management and maintenance processes. Heavy machinery downtime in workshops directly impacts productivity and profitability. The company needs a digital framework to optimize fleet availability and establish structured operational processes.

## Problems It Solves

### Primary Problems
- **Unplanned machinery downtime**: Heavy equipment sits idle in workshops due to poor maintenance coordination
- **Inefficient maintenance processes**: Lack of structured preventive maintenance scheduling
- **Poor inventory control**: No systematic tracking of spare parts and materials
- **Limited operational visibility**: Management lacks real-time insight into fleet status and maintenance activities
- **Manual coordination**: Paper-based or ad-hoc communication between operators, mechanics, and management

### Secondary Problems
- Difficulty tracking maintenance costs per unit
- Inconsistent service documentation
- Poor resource allocation for maintenance tasks
- Lack of historical data for decision-making

## How It Should Work

### Core Workflow
1. **Fleet Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard showing status of all vehicles (available, in-route, under maintenance, unassigned)
2. **Issue Reporting**: Operators can quickly report mechanical problems through mobile-friendly interface
3. **Maintenance Coordination**: Mechanics receive prioritized work orders with material requirements
4. **Inventory Integration**: Automatic checking of parts availability and procurement needs
5. **Service Documentation**: Complete logging of all maintenance activities with timestamps and materials used

### User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- **Speed**: Quick access to critical information and fast problem reporting
- **Reliability**: System availability matching operational hours (6 AM - 6 PM minimum)
- **Mobility**: Responsive design for tablets and mobile devices used in field
- **Collaboration**: Real-time updates visible to all relevant stakeholders

## Success Vision

A mining operation where:
- Fleet availability consistently exceeds 80%
- Maintenance issues are identified and resolved proactively
- All stakeholders have clear visibility into operational status
- Data-driven decisions replace reactive problem-solving
- Operational efficiency improvements are measurable and sustained
