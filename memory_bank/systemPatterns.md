# System Patterns

## System Architecture

### Platform Choice: Odoo Community 18.0
After evaluating custom development vs. ERP solution, chose Odoo for:
- Pre-built modules for Employees, Fleet, and Inventory
- Proven enterprise-grade architecture
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Faster time-to-market vs. building from scratch

### Deployment Architecture
```
Docker Container (Odoo 18.0)
├── PostgreSQL Database
├── Odoo Community Modules
│   ├── Employees Module
│   ├── Fleet Module
│   └── Inventory Module
└── Custom Configurations
```

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Docker-based Deployment**: Ensures consistent environment across development and production
2. **Modular Implementation**: Focus on core modules (Employees, Fleet, Inventory) before expanding
3. **Data Import Strategy**: CSV-based initial data loading for users, fleet, and inventory
4. **Role-based Access**: Leverage Odoo's built-in user management and permissions

## Design Patterns in Use

### Data Management Patterns
- **Master Data Management**: Centralized employee, fleet, and inventory records
- **Audit Trail**: Built-in Odoo logging for all data changes
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Department-based employee structure
- **Asset Lifecycle**: Fleet units with maintenance history tracking

### User Interface Patterns
- **Role-based Dashboards**: Different views for operators, mechanics, supervisors, and administrators
- **Mobile-first Design**: Responsive interface for field operations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show relevant information based on user role and context
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates for fleet and maintenance activities

### Integration Patterns
- **CSV Import/Export**: Standard data exchange format for initial setup and reporting
- **API-first Approach**: Leverage Odoo's REST API for future integrations
- **Modular Extensions**: Use Odoo's addon system for custom functionality

## Component Relationships

### Core Module Dependencies
```
Employees Module
├── Provides user authentication
├── Defines departmental hierarchy
└── Links to Fleet assignments

Fleet Module
├── Depends on Employees for operator assignments
├── Links to Inventory for maintenance materials
└── Generates maintenance work orders

Inventory Module
├── Tracks spare parts and materials
├── Links to Fleet for maintenance requirements
└── Supports procurement workflows
```

### Data Flow
1. **Employee Setup** → Department assignment → Fleet access permissions
2. **Fleet Registration** → Operator assignment → Maintenance scheduling
3. **Inventory Management** → Material availability → Maintenance execution
4. **Maintenance Workflow** → Work order creation → Material consumption → Status updates

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Docker environment configuration
2. Odoo installation and basic configuration
3. Employee module setup with departmental structure
4. Initial user import from CSV

### Phase 2: Fleet Integration
1. Fleet module configuration
2. Vehicle registration and operator assignments
3. Maintenance schedule templates
4. Integration with inventory for parts tracking

### Phase 3: Operational Workflows
1. Maintenance work order processes
2. Real-time status updates
3. Reporting and dashboard configuration
4. User training and adoption

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Considerations
- Target: Support 40 concurrent users
- Database optimization for fleet and inventory queries
- Mobile interface performance on tablets/smartphones

### Security Requirements
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure authentication for field operations
- Data backup and recovery procedures

### Scalability Patterns
- Modular architecture allows incremental feature addition
- Database design supports growth in fleet size and transaction volume
- Container-based deployment enables horizontal scaling if needed
